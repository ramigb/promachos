- Audit trails for accountability and governance
- Quality standards for reliable AI assistance

## PROTOCOL FILES
1. `core.md` - Complete protocol specification and collaboration rules
2. `config.yaml` - Collaboration contract and AI behavior rules
3. `project.md` - Structured project context and team objectives
4. `progress.json` - Quantified progress metrics and current phase
5. `tasks.json` - Structured task breakdown with clear ownership
6. `context.md` - Decision history for team continuity and handoffs

## PROTOCOL WORKFLOW
```
SESSION START:
1. Acknowledge Promachos Protocol understanding
2. Load collaboration rules from config.yaml
3. Assess current state: progress.json + context.md
4. Identify handoff context from previous team members
5. Establish session goals within protocol framework

COLLABORATION:
1. Follow established behavior rules and preferences
2. Update progress indicators systematically
3. Document all significant decisions in context.md
4. Save deliverables to artifacts/ with timestamps
5. Maintain task status and ownership in tasks.json

SESSION END:
1. Update progress.json with completion metrics
2. Document key decisions and insights in context.md
3. Prepare handoff notes for next team member/session
4. Ensure all outputs meet protocol quality standards
```
